# Amazon_SQL_Queries
SQL Queries on sample Amazon dataset 
In this project, I worked with a sample Amazon dataset to solve various business-oriented problems using SQL. I created tables, inserted data, and established relationships using primary and foreign keys to maintain data integrity. I applied core SQL concepts such as SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, LIMIT, and JOINS for data retrieval and analysis. I also used subqueries, CTEs, and window functions to handle complex queries, along with CASE statements for conditional logic. Additionally, I implemented stored procedures to automate tasks and improve query efficiency.
